## Abstract
This talk is primarily a code-oriented presentation that will focus on some D3 fundamentals, which will include some basic but useful data visualizations with transitions and animations, integration with Angular, and making them mobile-friendly.

## Hacking on this
I'm using gulp for sass watching and live reloading. Run the following commands to work on this locally:

    $ git clone https://github.com/victormejia/d3-angularoc.git 
    $ cd d3-angularoc
    $ npm install
    $ gulp watch
    
Then open up a browser on http://localhost:9000.
